# EIQ-Extensions
# Overview
## The background
During the API beta program, 90% of the use-cases were to build extensions.

The API now offers a way for user to build an psuedo-extension, however, the logic must live on non-EIQ controlled environments, thus meaning it cannot hook into any of the core platform functionality requiring a user to write such logic themselves (which massively increases barrier to getting them built, and increase users support overhead).

## The vision
We want to expose a way for users to build extensions in the way we do as quickly and easily as possible. We will do this through easy to understand technology and a comprehensive documentation portfolio.

Users will be able to share and access all extensions in a public place, this will include EIQ-own extensions (which will be open-sourced). Not only will this provide them with new extensions for tools they might also use developed by others (reducing the burden on EIQ engineering team) but also use existing extensions as inspiration (code snippets, learning, etc).

As extensions will need to conform to a defined standard (structure, behaviour, security), it will also allow EIQ Solutions/Professionals services team to easily build and support extensions in a way not possible today.

The EDK will offer a vendor agnostic interface (e.g. via API) to connect to data streams, control EDK functions, make requests to extensions, etc. The aim being to build a pipeline of new users in our ecosystem, with an easy upsell opportunity for them to use more fully featured products in our stack (IC, XDR, ER).

Our aim is to ship an open product that can be used by more than just EIQ customers for managing intel.
