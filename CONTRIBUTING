# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to the EclecticIQ Extensions repository. This document describes the Contribution process.

Contributing allows you to make the content that you build on the EclecticIQ Extensions Developer Kit available to every client. Content can be either EclecticIQ, Partner or Community supported.

All the content is open source and lives in this repository. By making a submission, you agree for distribution under an MIT license.

## Support and requirements

Extensions can be either officially supported by EclecticIQ (for extensions built by EclecticIQ), a Technology Partner, or an individual developer. This is defined on a per extension basis and support information can be found in each extensions manifest.
