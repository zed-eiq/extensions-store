The rootkit hooks kernel functions. This seemingly simple solution opens a wide range of opportunities, such as:<br>\r\n- hiding files and directories (by name);<br>\r\n- hiding outgoing TCP connections (as well as the activity of RAW and UDP sockets);<br>\r\n- hiding processes and process hierarchy;<br>\r\n- hiding CPU usage by a process (for example, you can use this to hide an activity of a miner);<br>\r\n- hiding rootkit kernel module to prevent its detection by running lsmod or checking the /sys structure;<br>\r\n- disabling selinux/audit for selected processes;<br>\r\n- stealthy loading the kernel module (no warnings of incorrect signature, plus reverting the taint flags to normal status);<br>\r\n- adding LD_PRELOAD to a specific process upon execution (for example, you can load a password-stealing module into ssh/scp etc.);<br>\r\n- running a stealthy back connect [proxy] using one of the \"port knocking\" techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rootkit is proven to work under CentOS 6.x/7.x and Ubuntu 14.x/16.x. It supports kernels from 2.6.32 to 4.x. There is not a single publicly known anti-rootkit tool that would detect this beast. So, I would like to know if people would be interested in buying such software either as a build or as a source code. Please note that it is not a some cheap GitHub-project, but a serious product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also consider selling separately some approaches, used by the rootkit kernel module, for example:<br>\r\n- framework for hooking Linux kernel functions (symbols) (x86, based on disassembler length);<br>\r\n- framework for calling non-exported Linux kernel functions;<br>\r\n- technique for hiding processes, network sockets, application activity, process environment modifications upon running (like adding LD_PRELOAD);<br>\r\n- technique for setting up back-connect shells;<br>\r\n- technique for protecting the module against detection through lsmod and /sys;<br>\r\n- technique for stealthy module loading without warning of \"incorrect signature\" etc.;<br>\r\n- technique for filtering the kernel log (kmsg);<br>\r\n- something else perhaps, I can\"t recollect =)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, I can consider selling the technique for stealthy autorun on CentOS/Ubuntu. Well, anyway, I’m looking forward to your general questions. If you\"re interested in something specific, please contact me via a PM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>P.S. A SSH/SCP sniffer written by me is still waiting for a buyer:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[see: https://titan.intel471.com/post_thread/7f5e797c91447d8ff92c222b92ab61e9?post_uid=2fb1a7387cc78040e388fdc71bd3e419 ]<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n[source: https://titan.intel471.com/post_thread/e8a9b8812feceb98ecf5b232ae1a2795 ]</p>\r\n"

But we did not submit it to any program. This is my form, I filled it.<br><br>[<strong>maga123</strong>]: The forms are mostly the same everywhere, I just picked up one and use it.<br>&lt;…&gt;<br>---</p><p>The actor <strong>mullah’s</strong> Jabber ID maga123@exploit.im shared the following fingerprint:</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">— Resource: jail.\n— Local time: 18:18:00 +0300.\n— Operating system: Windows XP.\n—Client:&amp;nbsp;Я.Онлайн 3.2.0.8873.\n---\n— Full name: maga123.</code></pre><p><br><strong>Detailed observations</strong><br><br>No further details about the alleged Mac OS zero-day vulnerability were provided. It is possible the one-day RCE vulnerability in the Apple Safari web browser <strong>mullah</strong> offered may refer to CVE-2019-8846, which recently was discovered and patched Dec. 10, 2019. The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) marker element feature of Apple Safari’s web kit. A remote attacker can use a specially crafted Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) webpage that triggers memory corruption when opened by a victim and executes arbitrary code on the target system. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to compromise the system.\\xa0<br><br>The actor provided no evidence of a PoC for the aforementioned vulnerability in Safari, and did not demonstrate the alleged zero-day vulnerability in the Foxmail client. Therefore, the truth of <strong>mullah’s\\xa0</strong>claims cannot be judged.<br><br>According to file metadata, the video <strong>mullah</strong> shared was recorded on a Mac OS X 10.15.3 (19D76). The video demonstrated loading the unsigned kernel text at /tmp/unharden.kext inside the Mac OS with enabled system integrity protection. The vulnerability PoC code was written in the C++ programming language. We also noticed two rather interesting strings in the PoC source code — “PS752_exploit” and “PS752_inject.” PS752 was the number of the Ukraine International Airlines Flight shot down Jan. 8, 2020, in Iran. However, there was no evidence suggesting the actor referred to that incident and it might be only a coincidence.<br><br>The actor’s repeated use of the pronoun “we” in the chat suggested <strong>mullah\\xa0</strong>most likely operates in a team.</p><p>\\xa0</p><p><strong>Key related activity</strong></p><p>Since our most recent update on the actor, <strong>mullah</strong> demonstrated a rather low level of public activity, added only 21 new posts on the forum and most were made in the forum section dedicated to software and malware development. The actor’s reputation improved to the seventh level and <strong>mullah\\xa0</strong>was endorsed by the actors <strong>Ameth</strong> and <strong>updated</strong>.</p><p>The actor’s most interesting posts included:</p><p>— Nov. 21, 2019: Sold an automated secure shell protocol (SSH)-based OpenSSH fuzzy-patching tool to embed backdoors (see: https://titan.intel471.com/post_thread/439559281f0e1b8c729ba85acbc1ce0f).</p><p>— March 25, 2019: Provided positive feedback for the actor <strong>Megatraffer</strong>, who provided code signing and secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates on the forum.</p><p>— Jan. 8, 2019: Offered a fully functional Linux kernel module (LKM) rootkit and miniature in-kernel implant with root back-connect functionality (see: https://titan.intel471.com/post_thread/a91c52af7d4ea8a5f8a0c0c903cd9456?post_uid=11dfc472da75580f0c461bdafb784bc4).</p><p><br><strong>Attachment</strong></p><p>— Screen Recording 2020-02-03 at 7.55.56 PM (sanitized).mov — A sanitized version of the demonstration video <strong>mullah</strong> shared.</p>",

      "executiveSummary":"<p>We previously covered <strong>mullah</strong> selling malware for Linux-based operating systems (see: Related Reports section). On Feb. 1, 2020, the actor\\xa0offered to sell an alleged zero-day vulnerability in Mac OS X versions 10.13 and later . The vulnerability proof of concept (PoC) code reportedly allows loading an unsigned kernel extension (aka “kext”) on Mac OS X versions 10.13 and later.\\xa0The actor claimed the available PoC code could disable the\\xa0hardened runtime service and obtain a dump of the keychain password management system. The actor suggested using the exploit in conjunction with a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability, since it requires root privileges to load an unsigned kernel extension. The actor <strong>mullah\\xa0</strong>provided our source with a demonstration video of the alleged vulnerability.</p><p>The actor also offered our source a one-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Apple Safari web browser and an alleged zero-day RCE vulnerability in the Foxmail version 7.2.15 freeware email client for Windows operating systems.</p>"
