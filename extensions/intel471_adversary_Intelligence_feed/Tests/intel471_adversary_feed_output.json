But we did not submit it to any program. This is my form, I filled it.<br><br>[<strong>maga123</strong>]: The forms are mostly the same everywhere, I just picked up one and use it.<br>&lt;…&gt;<br>---</p><p>The actor <strong>mullah’s</strong> Jabber ID maga123@exploit.im shared the following fingerprint:</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">— Resource: jail.\n— Local time: 18:18:00 +0300.\n— Operating system: Windows XP.\n—Client:&amp;nbsp;Я.Онлайн 3.2.0.8873.\n---\n— Full name: maga123.</code></pre><p><br><strong>Detailed observations</strong><br><br>No further details about the alleged Mac OS zero-day vulnerability were provided. It is possible the one-day RCE vulnerability in the Apple Safari web browser <strong>mullah</strong> offered may refer to CVE-2019-8846, which recently was discovered and patched Dec. 10, 2019. The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) marker element feature of Apple Safari’s web kit. A remote attacker can use a specially crafted Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) webpage that triggers memory corruption when opened by a victim and executes arbitrary code on the target system. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an attacker to compromise the system.\\xa0<br><br>The actor provided no evidence of a PoC for the aforementioned vulnerability in Safari, and did not demonstrate the alleged zero-day vulnerability in the Foxmail client. Therefore, the truth of <strong>mullah’s\\xa0</strong>claims cannot be judged.<br><br>According to file metadata, the video <strong>mullah</strong> shared was recorded on a Mac OS X 10.15.3 (19D76). The video demonstrated loading the unsigned kernel text at /tmp/unharden.kext inside the Mac OS with enabled system integrity protection. The vulnerability PoC code was written in the C++ programming language. We also noticed two rather interesting strings in the PoC source code — “PS752_exploit” and “PS752_inject.” PS752 was the number of the Ukraine International Airlines Flight shot down Jan. 8, 2020, in Iran. However, there was no evidence suggesting the actor referred to that incident and it might be only a coincidence.<br><br>The actor’s repeated use of the pronoun “we” in the chat suggested <strong>mullah\\xa0</strong>most likely operates in a team.</p><p>\\xa0</p><p><strong>Key related activity</strong></p><p>Since our most recent update on the actor, <strong>mullah</strong> demonstrated a rather low level of public activity, added only 21 new posts on the forum and most were made in the forum section dedicated to software and malware development. The actor’s reputation improved to the seventh level and <strong>mullah\\xa0</strong>was endorsed by the actors <strong>Ameth</strong> and <strong>updated</strong>.</p><p>The actor’s most interesting posts included:</p><p>— Nov. 21, 2019: Sold an automated secure shell protocol (SSH)-based OpenSSH fuzzy-patching tool to embed backdoors (see: https://titan.intel471.com/post_thread/439559281f0e1b8c729ba85acbc1ce0f).</p><p>— March 25, 2019: Provided positive feedback for the actor <strong>Megatraffer</strong>, who provided code signing and secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates on the forum.</p><p>— Jan. 8, 2019: Offered a fully functional Linux kernel module (LKM) rootkit and miniature in-kernel implant with root back-connect functionality (see: https://titan.intel471.com/post_thread/a91c52af7d4ea8a5f8a0c0c903cd9456?post_uid=11dfc472da75580f0c461bdafb784bc4).</p><p><br><strong>Attachment</strong></p><p>— Screen Recording 2020-02-03 at 7.55.56 PM (sanitized).mov — A sanitized version of the demonstration video <strong>mullah</strong> shared.</p></p><p>On\\xa0Feb. 1, 2020, the actor <strong>mullah</strong> posted the following at the Exploit cybercrime forum:<br>---</p><p><strong>[OSX][0day] Unsigned KEXT load technique</strong><br>I'm selling a technique for loading an unsigned kernel extension (kext) implemented for OSX versions 10.13 and later (including the most recent one).<br>You will need root privileges to load an unsigned kext. Therefore, this exploit will most probably be a part of your exploit chain. Additionally, a POC sample has been developed to show this technique in action. The sample allows disabling run-time hardening and getting a _complete_ dump of the keychain (the system for storing keys and passwords) on the latest OSX version.<br>If you want to purchase it, PM me please.
